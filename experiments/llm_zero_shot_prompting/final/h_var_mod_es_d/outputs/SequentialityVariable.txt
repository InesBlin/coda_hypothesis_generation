When comparing studies where nan is nan and studies where nan is nan, When comparing studies where `Endogenous position` is `true` and studies where `Endogenous position` is `false`, `cooperation` from studies involving `Simultaneous` as `Sequentiality` are significantly `higher` than effect sizes based on `Sequential turn-taking` as `Sequentiality`. from studies involving nan as nan are significantly nan than effect sizes based on nan as nan.
