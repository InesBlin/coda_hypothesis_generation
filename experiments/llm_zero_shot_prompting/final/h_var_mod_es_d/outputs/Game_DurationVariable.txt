When comparing studies where nan is nan and studies where nan is nan, When comparing studies where `Known endgame` is `true` and studies where `Known endgame` is `false`, `cooperation` from studies involving `High` as `Continuation probability level` are significantly higher than effect sizes based on `Low` as `Continuation probability level`. from studies involving nan as nan are significantly nan than effect sizes based on nan as nan.
