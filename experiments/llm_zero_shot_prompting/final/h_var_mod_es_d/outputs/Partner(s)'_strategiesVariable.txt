When comparing studies where Iterated strategy is GRIT and studies where Iterated strategy is Preprogrammed Cooperation Rate, cooperation from studies involving High as Iterated pre-programmed cooperation rate level are significantly higher than effect sizes based on Low as Iterated pre-programmed cooperation rate level.
When comparing studies where Iterated pre-programmed cooperation rate level is High and studies where Iterated pre-programmed cooperation rate level is Low, cooperation from studies involving GRIT as Iterated strategy are significantly lower than effect sizes based on Preprogrammed Cooperation Rate as Iterated strategy.
