When comparing studies where Uncertainty level is Low and studies where Uncertainty level is High, cooperation from studies involving Return from public account as Uncertainty target is significantly higher than cooperation from studies involving based on Return from private account as Uncertainty target.
When comparing studies where Uncertainty level is Low and studies where Uncertainty level is High, cooperation from studies involving Threshold as Uncertainty target is significantly higher than cooperation from studies involving based on Loss as Uncertainty target.
When comparing studies where Uncertainty level is Low and studies where Uncertainty level is Medium, cooperation from studies involving Return from public account as Uncertainty target is significantly higher than cooperation from studies involving based on Return from private account as Uncertainty target.
When comparing studies where Uncertainty target is Return from public account and studies where Uncertainty target is Return from private account, cooperation from studies involving Low as Uncertainty level is significantly lower than cooperation from studies involving based on High as Uncertainty level.
When comparing studies where Uncertainty target is Threshold and studies where Uncertainty target is Loss, cooperation from studies involving Low as Uncertainty level is significantly lower than cooperation from studies involving based on High as Uncertainty level.
