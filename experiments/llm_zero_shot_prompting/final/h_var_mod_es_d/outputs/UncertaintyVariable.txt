When comparing studies where Uncertainty level is Low and studies where Uncertainty level is High, contributions from studies involving Threshold as Uncertainty target are significantly higher than effect sizes based on Loss as Uncertainty target.
When comparing studies where Uncertainty level is Low and studies where Uncertainty level is High, contributions from studies involving Return from public account as Uncertainty target are significantly higher than effect sizes based on Return from private account as Uncertainty target.
When comparing studies where Uncertainty level is Medium and studies where Uncertainty level is High, contributions from studies involving Return from public account as Uncertainty target are significantly higher than effect sizes based on Return from private account as Uncertainty target.
