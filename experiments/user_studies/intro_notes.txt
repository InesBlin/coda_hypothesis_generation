In this user study, we are interested in seeing if AI-based methods can help social scientists generate hypotheses. We are interested more particularly in hypotheses on how humans cooperate.

Our starting point was the COoperation DAtabank (CODA) dataset. CODA "consists in 3,000 studies from the social and behavioural sciences published in 3 languages and annotated with more than 300 cooperation-related features, including characteristics of the sample participating in the study (e.g. sample size, average age of sample, percentage of males, country of participants), characteristics of the experimental paradigm (structure of the social dilemma, incentives, repeated trial data), and quantitative results of the experiment (e.g. mean levels of cooperation, variance in cooperation, and effect sizes)." [1]

To make the hypotheses more comparable against each other, we have first worked with experts to lay out templates about the hypotheses that can be generated. They are all based on the vocabulary on which the CODA dataset was built.

We distinguish between three types of hypotheses:

1 - regular

Template: Cooperation is significantly {comparative} when {concept} is {concept_val_1} compared to when {concept} is {concept_val_2}.		
Example: Cooperation is significantly higher when Anonymity manipulation is high compared to when Anonymity manipulation is low.		

2 - categorical study

Template: When comparing studies where {concept} is {concept_val_1} and studies where {concept} is {concept_val_2}, cooperation is significantly {comparative} when {mod} is {mod_val} compared to when {mod} has another value.		
Example: When comparing studies where Gender is Male and studies where Gender is Female, cooperation is significantly higher when Discussion is Bi-Directional compared to when Discussion has another value.		

3 - categorical variable

Template: When comparing studies where {concept} is {concept_val_1} and studies where {concept} is {concept_val_2}, cooperation from studies involving {mod_val_1} as {mod} is significantly {comparative} than cooperation from studies involving {mod_val_2} as {mod}		
Example: When comparing studies where Leader's behaviour is Cooperative and studies where Leader's behaviour is non-cooperative, cooperation from studies involving Authority as Leadership assignment rule is significantly higher than cooperation based on Fixed as Leadership assignment rule.

In this user study, you will be asked to assess the three types of hypotheses, each on two generic independent variables (GIV). For each type of hypotheses and GIV, you will have three sub-tasks:

(A) Create your own hypotheses from the given vocabulary;
(B) Score & Rank the hypotheses generated by AI method;
(C) Rank (A) and (B) together.

The GIV are:
- For the regular hypotheses: ReputationVariable, PersonalityVariable
- For the categorical study hypotheses: GenderVariable, IncentivesVariable
- For the categorical variable hypotheses: LeadershipVariable, IdentificationVariable

You are also given access to a detailed documentation on the types of hypotheses that you can generate: 

We thank you in advance for your time and availability, and look forward to the results of the analyses.
