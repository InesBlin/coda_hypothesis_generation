In this task, we are interested in formulating hypotheses on how humans cooperate, and particularly related to resource_dilemma_game variables. There are constraints on how you can generate the hypotheses. 

[DATA][csv format]
```
siv1,sivv1,siv2,sivv2
replenishment rate level,high,replenishment rate level,low
resource size level,high,resource size level,medium
resource size level,low,resource size level,medium
replenishment rate level,high,replenishment rate level,medium
replenishment rate level,medium,replenishment rate level,low
resource size level,low,resource size level,high
```

[HYPOTHESES]
A valid hypothesis should be in the format
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv1` is `sivv1`, compared to when `siv2` is `sivv2`
```
or 
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv2` is `sivv2`, compared to when `siv1` is `sivv1`
```

[TASK]
You need to generate the most sensible and coherent hypotheses. When generating the hypothesis, keep the bracket and the original names from the csv. In your response, only list the hypotheses.
