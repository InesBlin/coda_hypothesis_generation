In this task, we are interested in formulating hypotheses on how humans cooperate, and particularly related to intergroup_competition_ variables. There are constraints on how you can generate the hypotheses. 

[DATA][csv format]
```
siv1,sivv1,siv2,sivv2
intergroup competition,individual group,intergroup competition,intergroup competition
intergroup competition,individual group,intergroup competition,intergroup comparison
intergroup competition,intergroup competition,intergroup competition,intergroup comparison
intergroup competition,individual group,intergroup competition,intergroup prisoner's dilemma
```

[HYPOTHESES]
A valid hypothesis should be in the format
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv1` is `sivv1`, compared to when `siv2` is `sivv2`
```
or 
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv2` is `sivv2`, compared to when `siv1` is `sivv1`
```

[TASK]
You need to generate the most sensible and coherent hypotheses. When generating the hypothesis, keep the bracket and the original names from the csv. In your response, only list the hypotheses.
