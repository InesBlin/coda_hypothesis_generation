In this task, we are interested in formulating hypotheses on how humans cooperate, and particularly related to framing variables. There are constraints on how you can generate the hypotheses. 

[DATA][csv format]
```
siv1,sivv1,siv2,sivv2
context frame,competitive,context frame,moral
context frame,cooperative,context frame,moral
gain-loss frame,gain,gain-loss frame,loss
public good-bad frame,public bad,public good-bad frame,public good
context frame,generic,context frame,moral
context frame,cooperative,context frame,competitive
context frame,cooperative,context frame,generic
context frame,competitive,context frame,generic
give-take frame,give-some,give-take frame,take-some
```

[HYPOTHESES]
A valid hypothesis should be in the format
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv1` is `sivv1`, compared to when `siv2` is `sivv2`
```
or 
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv2` is `sivv2`, compared to when `siv1` is `sivv1`
```

[TASK]
You need to generate the most sensible and coherent hypotheses. When generating the hypothesis, keep the bracket and the original names from the csv. In your response, only list the hypotheses.
