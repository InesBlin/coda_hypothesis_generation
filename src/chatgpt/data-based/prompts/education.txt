In this task, we are interested in formulating hypotheses on how humans cooperate, and particularly related to education variables. There are constraints on how you can generate the hypotheses. 

[DATA][csv format]
```
siv1,sivv1,siv2,sivv2
academic grade level,junior,academic grade level,senior
academic discipline,others,academic discipline,psychology
academic discipline,others,academic discipline,economics
```

[HYPOTHESES]
A valid hypothesis should be in the format
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv1` is `sivv1`, compared to when `siv2` is `sivv2`
```
or 
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv2` is `sivv2`, compared to when `siv1` is `sivv1`
```

[TASK]
You need to generate the most sensible and coherent hypotheses. When generating the hypothesis, keep the bracket and the original names from the csv. In your response, only list the hypotheses.
