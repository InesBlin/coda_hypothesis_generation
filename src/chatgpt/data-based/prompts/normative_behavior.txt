In this task, we are interested in formulating hypotheses on how humans cooperate, and particularly related to normative_behavior variables. There are constraints on how you can generate the hypotheses. 

[DATA][csv format]
```
siv1,sivv1,siv2,sivv2
descriptive norm,low cooperation,descriptive norm,medium cooperation
group variability,low,group variability,high
descriptive norm,low cooperation,descriptive norm,high cooperation
descriptive norm,medium cooperation,descriptive norm,high cooperation
```

[HYPOTHESES]
A valid hypothesis should be in the format
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv1` is `sivv1`, compared to when `siv2` is `sivv2`
```
or 
```
Cooperation is significantly <higher/lower> when `siv2` is `sivv2`, compared to when `siv1` is `sivv1`
```

[TASK]
You need to generate the most sensible and coherent hypotheses. When generating the hypothesis, keep the bracket and the original names from the csv. In your response, only list the hypotheses.
