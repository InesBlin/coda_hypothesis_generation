Certainly! Here are five hypotheses respecting the provided constraints:

Cooperation is significantly higher when IdentificationLevel is medium, compared to when IdentificationLevel is low.
Cooperation is significantly lower when GroupType is natural_group, compared to when GroupType is experimentally_induced_group.
Cooperation is significantly higher when TargetMembership is stranger, compared to when TargetMembership is outgroup.
Cooperation is significantly lower when KnowledgeOfMembership is common, compared to when KnowledgeOfMembership is unknown.
Cooperation is significantly higher when EntitativityLevel is high, compared to when EntitativityLevel is medium.
